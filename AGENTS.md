# AGENTS.md — project context for AI coding agents

> `CLAUDE.md` imports this file (`@AGENTS.md`) and adds Claude-Code-specific workflow
> notes on top. Keep project-wide context here so both files can't drift apart.

## Repository standard

This repository follows the solarssk engineering standard: https://github.com/solarssk/playbook
Tier: 2 (see playbook/docs/tiers.md) — it ships a container image and runs as a
deploy-and-forget service, which puts it at Tier 2 by the tier system's own first
question, even though it has one maintainer and a narrow, deliberately small feature set.

Compliance with the Tier 2 checklist is checked mechanically on every push and PR by
`.github/workflows/verify-standard.yml`, a reusable workflow from `solarssk/playbook`
that reads the "Tier: 2" line above and runs the matching file/pattern checks (SHA-pinning,
`SECURITY.md`, issue templates, `concurrency:` blocks, and more). It fails the build on a
hard miss and warns on a soft one; it does not replace judgment on tier choice itself.

## What this project is

`mail-autodiscover` is a stateless FastAPI service that returns mail client configuration
(IMAP/SMTP/POP3) for allowed domains. It serves three autodiscovery protocols:

- **Outlook Autodiscover** — `POST /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml`
- **Thunderbird Autoconfig** — `GET /mail/config-v1.1.xml`
- **Apple Mail profile** — `GET /mail/ios.mobileconfig`

There is no database, no admin panel, no mailbox existence check, and no LDAP integration.
Keep it that way.

## Critical security invariant — never break this

The service must return **the same response shape** for every syntactically valid address in an
allowed domain, regardless of whether the mailbox actually exists. Any code path that reveals
whether `alice@example.com` exists while `bob@example.com` does not is a bug.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |

| XML parsing | `defusedxml` (safe) |
| XML escaping | `html.escape(..., quote=False)` |
| YAML | `PyYAML` |
| Server | `uvicorn[standard]` |
| Python | ≥ 3.12 |

## Local development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
cp .env.example .env          # set APP_ENV=development
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Set `APP_ENV=development` or `APP_ENV=test` to bypass production-only startup validation.

## Running checks

```bash
./scripts/check.sh                        # full CI mirror (ruff, mypy, pytest, bandit, etc.)
SKIP_PIP_AUDIT=1 SKIP_DEPTRY=1 ./scripts/check.sh  # skip slower scans
pytest                                    # tests only
```

## Configuration modes

**Single-domain (ENV):** set `ALLOWED_DOMAINS`, `IMAP_HOST`, `SMTP_HOST`, etc. in `.env`.

**Multi-domain (YAML):** set `CONFIG_FILE=/config/config.yaml` and mount a YAML file that
follows the shape in `config/config.example.yaml`. When `CONFIG_FILE` exists and is valid,
ENV-based `ALLOWED_DOMAINS`/`IMAP_*`/`SMTP_*` values are ignored for routing.

`USERNAME_FORMAT` is always read from ENV, even in YAML mode.

## Release process

1. Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml`.
2. Add a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` entry in `CHANGELOG.md` following the hybrid format
   described in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (narrative sections first, then KaC technical sections).
3. Update the version comparison links at the bottom of `CHANGELOG.md`:
   each `[VERSION]` must link to `compare/vPREV...vVERSION`.
4. Open a PR, merge to `main`. That's it — no manual tag push.

`release.yml` runs on every push to `main` and compares `pyproject.toml`'s version before and
after: if it changed and `CHANGELOG.md` has a matching `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading, it
creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag and GitHub Release (notes formatted from that CHANGELOG entry),
dispatches `docker-publish.yml` for that tag (GHCR + Docker Hub, tag pushes made by
`GITHUB_TOKEN` don't self-trigger other workflows), and closes the matching `vX.Y.Z` milestone
if one is open. Any other push is a no-op for this workflow. If the version bumped but the
CHANGELOG heading is missing or misdated, it skips with a warning instead of creating a
broken release — fix the CHANGELOG entry and push again.

## Things to be careful about

- **No `--no-verify` on commits** — pre-commit hooks enforce code quality.
- **Never log full email addresses** — `security.py` intentionally logs only domain hashes.
- **Proxy header trust is off by default** (`TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=false`). Do not change the
  default.
- **Production startup validation** in `config.py` rejects placeholder values and unsafe proxy
  settings — do not weaken it.
- **Rate limiter is in-process** — one counter per uvicorn worker. Document this limitation
  when discussing multi-worker deployments.
- **XML escaping uses `html.escape(..., quote=False)`**, not `xml.sax.saxutils.escape`.
  Keep it that way (Bandit B406).
- **Runtime dependencies are locked in `requirements.txt`** (hash-pinned, generated with
  `pip-compile`). If you change `[project.dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`, regenerate
  it under Python 3.14 (matching the Dockerfile's base image, not this repo's usual 3.12
  dev-tooling version — `pip-compile` resolves marker-conditional dependencies using
  whatever interpreter runs it): `pip-compile --generate-hashes --allow-unsafe -o
  requirements.txt pyproject.toml`. CI fails if the two drift apart.
- **CI's own dev-tool installs are hash-pinned too** (`requirements-test.txt`,
  `requirements-lint.txt`, `requirements-typecheck.txt`, `requirements-security.txt`, one
  per extra each CI job installs from). If you change `test`/`lint`/`typecheck`/`security`
  in `[project.optional-dependencies]`, regenerate the matching file under Python 3.12
  (this repo's floor, and what those CI jobs run on): `pip-compile --extra test
  --generate-hashes --allow-unsafe -o requirements-test.txt pyproject.toml` (swap the extra
  name and output file). CI regenerates and diffs `requirements.txt` and the four dev-tool
  lockfiles in two separate jobs (different interpreters, see above). The `dev` extra itself
  (local setup only, never installed by CI) stays unlocked.
- **The Dockerfile's `apt-get upgrade` step must stay after `COPY`/`pip install`, with its
  `ARG CACHEBUST`** — moving it earlier (or dropping the ARG) silently brings back a real bug
  that shipped for a while undetected: Docker's build cache keys that layer only on its
  command text and the base image's own pinned digest, so without a per-build cache-buster it
  gets served from `docker-publish.yml`'s `cache-from: type=gha` forever after the first build
  off a given digest — the image then stops receiving Debian security patches even though the
  workflow appears to build normally every time (confirmed: `apt-get upgrade` showed `CACHED`
  in every build log for weeks, and a forced rebuild found a real pending OpenSSL update).
  `docker-publish.yml` passes `CACHEBUST=${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}`, not
  the commit SHA — a `workflow_dispatch` on an unchanged `main`, or a re-run of an existing
  run, would otherwise keep the same SHA and hit the same stale cache again.
