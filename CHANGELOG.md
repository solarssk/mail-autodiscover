## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-21

### What's new

- Documentation corrections only; no runtime or configuration changes.

### What this means

- CHANGELOG version links now point to the correct diff range for each release.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` correctly references the `docs/` directory instead of the GitHub Wiki, which was superseded in `0.3.0`.
- `pyproject.toml` project description now includes Apple Mail, which has been supported since `0.2.0`.

### Action required

- No action required.

### Changed

- Fixed all CHANGELOG version comparison links — each link now points to `compare/vPREV...vVERSION` for its own release.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md`: replaced the stale reference to the GitHub Wiki with the `docs/` directory.
- Updated `pyproject.toml` description to include Apple Mail profile support.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-20

### What's new

- Security hardening for the public autodiscover endpoints and their access logs.
- Maintenance updates for the Docker base image and GitHub secret-scanning action.

### What this means

- Plain text access logs are harder to spoof. Request-controlled values such as `X-Request-ID` and URL paths can no longer inject extra log lines or fake `key=value` fields like `status=200`.
- HTTPS deployments now send stricter browser security headers on normal responses and rate-limited `429` responses.
- The GHCR Docker image now builds on the Python 3.14 slim Bookworm base image.
- CI secret scanning now uses `gitleaks/gitleaks-action` v3, which moves the action runtime to Node 24.

### Action required

- No configuration changes are required for existing deployments.
- If you run multiple uvicorn/Gunicorn workers, keep an external rate limiter in front of the service. The built-in limiter is intentionally in-process and each worker has its own counter.

### Security

- Sanitized `X-Request-ID` before storing it on request state, returning it to clients, or writing it to logs. Only token-safe characters are kept.
- Sanitized logged URL paths so control characters, whitespace, and `=` cannot create forged fields in text-mode access logs.
- Added `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000` when `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` uses HTTPS. The header intentionally does not include `includeSubDomains` by default, because this app cannot know whether sibling subdomains are HTTPS-ready.
- Added `Content-Security-Policy` and `Permissions-Policy` headers.
- Applied security headers to rate-limited `429` responses as well as normal responses.
- Replaced `xml.sax.saxutils.escape` with `html.escape(..., quote=False)` for XML response text escaping, removing the Bandit B406 warning without changing output behavior.

### Changed

- Updated `Dockerfile` from `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` to `python:3.14-slim-bookworm`.
- Updated CI secret scanning from `gitleaks/gitleaks-action` v2 to v3.
- Documented the built-in rate limiter's multi-worker limitation in `SECURITY.md`.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for request ID sanitization, URL path log sanitization, exact CSP/Permissions-Policy values, HSTS behavior, and security headers on rate-limited responses.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-12

### What's new

- Security hardening for reverse-proxy client IP handling and stricter production validation of `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS`.

### Fixed

- Prefer `X-Real-IP` over `X-Forwarded-For` when the direct peer is a trusted proxy, preventing spoofed leftmost XFF entries from bypassing rate limits or polluting logs.
- Parse `X-Forwarded-For` from right to left, skipping trusted proxy hops, when `X-Real-IP` is missing or invalid.

### Changed

- In production, every non-empty `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` entry must be a valid IP or CIDR; invalid tokens now fail startup instead of being silently ignored.
- Nginx reverse-proxy docs now recommend `X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr` instead of `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` for single-hop deployments.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-12

### What's new

- Production-complete release before `1.0`: multi-domain YAML config, deployment docs, `/ready`, and optional JSON access logs.

### What this means

- You can run one container for multiple mail domains via mounted `config/config.yaml`, or keep the existing single-profile ENV mode.
- Reverse-proxy, DNS, client, and troubleshooting guides now live in `docs/`.

### Action required

- If you upgrade from `0.2.x`, review the updated README and mount `./config:/config:ro` when using YAML mode.
- Set `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` when `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` in production (unchanged from `0.2.2`).

### Added

- Optional multi-domain YAML config via `CONFIG_FILE` with per-domain IMAP/SMTP/POP3 settings.
- `GET /ready` readiness endpoint for container and reverse-proxy health checks.
- Optional structured JSON access logs via `STRUCTURED_JSON_LOGS=true`.
- In-repo deployment guides under `docs/` plus sample multi-domain config in `config/config.example.yaml`.

### Changed

- Apple Mail `.mobileconfig` downloads now use clearer per-domain filenames and mailbox-specific profile labels.
- Docker Compose examples now mount `/config` and expose the new config/logging settings.

### Fixed

- Reject YAML config files that define an empty `domains` map instead of silently falling back to ENV mode.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-12

### What's new

- This is a small follow-up release that closes a rate-limit configuration gap introduced in `0.2.2`.

### What this means

- Production deployments now reject `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CLIENTS <= 0` instead of accepting a value that would silently weaken throttling behavior.

### Action required

- No action required if you already use a positive `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CLIENTS` value.
- If you explicitly set `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CLIENTS=0` or a negative value, replace it with a positive number before upgrading.

### Fixed

- Reject non-positive `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CLIENTS` values when rate limiting is enabled, preventing ineffective throttling caused by immediate client-eviction behavior.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-12

### What's new

- Production deployments now fail fast on unsafe placeholder configuration instead of starting with `example.com` defaults.
- Reverse-proxy trust is safer by default: forwarded headers require explicit trusted proxy CIDRs.

### What this means

- Misconfigured production stacks surface a clear startup error instead of silently serving placeholder mail settings.
- Rate limiting uses a bounded in-memory store with periodic cleanup, reducing memory growth under abuse.

### Action required

- If you run behind a reverse proxy with `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true`, set `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` to your proxy or Docker bridge CIDRs before upgrading to `0.2.2` in production.
- Review reverse-proxy access logs: Thunderbird and Apple Mail endpoints pass `emailaddress` in the query string.

### Security

- Default `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` changed to `false`; empty `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` no longer trusts all peers.
- `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` values are validated as real IP addresses before use.
- Production startup validation for HTTPS `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, real domains, and proxy trust settings.

### Added

- `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CLIENTS` and `RATE_LIMIT_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` for bounded rate-limit storage.
- Stable UUIDv5 identifiers in Apple `.mobileconfig` profiles (re-download updates the same profile).
- Healthcheck in `docker-compose.ghcr.yml`.

### Changed

- `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` default is now `false` in application config, `.env.example`, and GHCR compose.
- Trivy blocks CRITICAL vulnerabilities on pull requests; `main` keeps advisory SARIF upload.

### Fixed

- `docker-compose.ghcr.yml` port mapping now respects `CONTAINER_PORT`.
- Apple `.mobileconfig` `PayloadIdentifier` values are account-specific so multiple mailboxes on one domain do not collide.
- `docker-compose.ghcr.yml` default `IMAGE_TAG` matches the release version (`0.2.2`).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-11

### What's new

- The project now lives at `mail-autodiscover`, with GHCR images published only under `ghcr.io/solarssk/mail-autodiscover`.
- Documentation moved to the GitHub Wiki, and the public Python API is now documented with module docstrings.

### What this means

- New installs have one canonical repository and container image name.
- Admins follow wiki links from the README instead of the removed in-repo `wiki/` folder.

### Action required

- Pull `ghcr.io/solarssk/mail-autodiscover` instead of the retired `ghcr.io/solarssk/autodiscover` package path.
- Pin `IMAGE_TAG=0.2.1` (or newer) in production rather than the old `autodiscover` image tags.

### Changed

- GitHub repository renamed to `mail-autodiscover`; GHCR images publish as `ghcr.io/solarssk/mail-autodiscover`
- Documentation now links to the GitHub Wiki instead of the in-repo `wiki/` folder
- Replace flaky GitHub CodeQL default setup with explicit `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
- Add docstrings across the `app/` package for public API and security helpers

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-10

### What's new

- This release makes reverse-proxy deployments safer, adds a simple landing page, and introduces Apple Mail profile downloads.

### What this means

- Admins get clearer logging, better control over forwarded headers, and a cleaner user-facing entry point.
- End users on iPhone, iPad, and Mac can install a mail profile instead of entering all settings by hand.

### Action required

- If you run the service behind a reverse proxy, review and set `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` for your own proxy or Docker network ranges.
- If you deploy with Portainer or GHCR images, prefer the pinned `0.2.0` tag in production.

### Added

- `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` / `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` so forwarded client IP headers are trusted only from your configured proxy CIDRs
- `ACCESS_LOG_SKIP_PATHS` to reduce noise from health checks and static asset requests
- Apple Mail `.mobileconfig` profiles (`GET /mail/ios.mobileconfig`, `/.well-known/apple-mail.mobileconfig`)
- HTML landing page, `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`
- `docker-compose.ghcr.yml` example for Portainer / GHCR deployments

### Changed

- Unified access logs now show `client_ip`, method, endpoint, and status in a single line
- `GET /` now returns a small landing page instead of JSON metadata
- `/health` is no longer rate limited

### Security

- Forwarded headers are honored only when the direct peer matches `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` when that setting is present

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-10

### What's new

- This is a maintenance and hardening release focused on container safety and CI security checks.

### What this means

- Runtime behavior stays the same, but the delivery pipeline and base image are more defensive.

### Action required

- No action required.

### Security

- Docker image hardening: `python:3.12-slim-bookworm`, `apt-get upgrade`, pip >= `26.1.2`
- CodeQL-related test adjustments to avoid unsafe URL substring assertions

### Note

- CodeQL ran via GitHub default setup in this release

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-10

### What's new

- This is a dependency and CI maintenance release.

### What this means

- There are no product-level changes for admins or end users, only safer and cleaner project maintenance.

### Action required

- No action required.

### Changed

- Bump `actions/checkout` to `v6.0.3`
- Bump `gitleaks/gitleaks-action` through Dependabot

### Note

- Python `3.14` Docker base image bump was intentionally declined to keep CI and runtime aligned on `3.12`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-10

### What's new

- First public release of `mail-autodiscover` with Outlook and Thunderbird support, Docker packaging, and baseline security controls.

### What this means

- Self-hosted mail admins can expose standards-based autodiscovery without building a custom service.
- The service is ready for simple production deployments where one domain or a small set of domains share the same mail settings.

### Action required

- Configure your environment variables, deploy behind HTTPS, and create the required DNS records before pointing users to the service.

### Added

- Outlook Autodiscover (`POST /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml`)
- Thunderbird Autoconfig (`GET /mail/config-v1.1.xml`)
- Environment-based configuration via `pydantic-settings`
- Docker and Docker Compose support
- Security middleware for rate limiting, headers, and safe logging
- `pytest` test suite with coverage gate
- Hardened CI with `gitleaks`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `bandit`, `pip-audit`, `deptry`, and Trivy
- GHCR image publishing (`ghcr.io/solarssk/mail-autodiscover`)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue templates, PR template, and Dependabot
- Branch protection and repository labels
